; Exercise 1.3: Fermat optics

; Fermat observed that the laws of reflection and refraction could be accounted
; for by the following facts: Light travels in a straight line in any particular
; medium with a velocity that depends upon the medium. The path taken by a ray
; from a source to a destination through any sequence of media is a path of
; least total time, compared to neighboring paths. Show that these facts imply
; the laws of reflection and refraction.*

; * For reflection the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.
; Refraction is described by Snell's law: when light passes from one medium to
; another, the ratio of the sines of the angles made to the normal to the
; interface is the inverse of the ratio of the refractive indices of the media.
; The refractive index is the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum to the speed
; of light in the medium.

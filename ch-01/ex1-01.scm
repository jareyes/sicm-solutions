; Exercise 1.1: Degrees of freedom

; For each of the mechanical systems described below, give the number of degrees
; of freedom of the configuration space.
;
; a. Three juggling pins.
;
; b. A spherical pendulum, consisting of a point mass (the pendulum bob) hanging
;    from a rigid massless rod attached to a fixed support point. The pendulum
;    bob may move in any direction subject to the constraint imposed by the
;    rigid rod. The point mass is subject to the uniform force of gravity.
;
; c. A spherical double pendulum, consisting of one point mass hanging from a
;    rigid massless rod attached to second point mass hanging from a second
;    massless rod attached to a fixed support point. The point masses are
;    subject to the uniform force of gravity.
;
; d. A point mass sliding without friction on a rigid curved wire.
;
; e. A top consisting of a rigid axisymmetric body with one point on the
;    symmetry axis of the body attached to a fixed support, subject to a uniform
;    gravitational force.
;
; f. The same as *e*, but not axisymmetric.
